# Sales-Data-Analysis

## Introduction

In this documentation, we will guide you through a series of tasks related to analyzing sales data in Microsoft Excel. The tasks involve calculating various metrics such as total revenue and profit, average revenue and units sold per order, total discount given, the number of sales recorded, the highest profit generated, and creating a custom column named 'Sales Range' based on specific criteria. The goal is to help you efficiently analyze sales data and gain insights from it.

## Project Objectives and Goals

Calculate Key Metrics: 
Determine total revenue and profit, average revenue and units sold per order, total discount given, the number of sales recorded, and the highest profit generated.

Enhance Data Interpretation:
Create a 'Sales Range' column to classify sales as 'High Sales' or 'Low Sales' based on predefined criteria.

- Custom Column Creation
- Data Analysis

## Steps Implemented on Project

### Data Analysis:

- Open Microsoft Excel and create a new workbook.

- In a new worksheet, import the sales data.

- Calculate the total revenue by using the SUM function on the revenue column.

- Calculate the total profit by using the SUM function on the profit column.

- Calculate the average revenue by using the AVERAGE function on the revenue column.

- Calculate the average units sold per order by using the AVERAGE function on the units sold column.

- Calculate the total discount given by using the SUM function on the discount column.

- Determine the number of sales recorded by using the COUNTIF function.

- Find the highest profit generated by using the MAX function on the profit column.

### Data Classification:

- Create a new column named 'Sales Range' in the dataset.

- Use a conditional statement to classify sales as 'High Sales' if the sales value is above the calculated average revenue, otherwise, classify them as 'Low Sales'.
